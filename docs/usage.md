# Usage

ReBench is a command-line tool. In the following, we will discuss its usage.
A basic help can be displayed with the `--help` argument:

```bash
$ rebench --help
Usage: rebench [options] <config> [exp_name] [vm:$]* [s:$]*

Argument:
  config    required argument, file containing the experiment to be executed
  exp_name  optional argument, the name of an experiment definition
            from the config file
            If not provided, the configured default_experiment is used.
            If 'all' is given, all experiments will be executed.

  vm:$      filter experiments to only include the named VM, example: vm:VM1 vm:VM3
  s:$       filter experiments to only include the named suite and possibly benchmark
            example: s:Suite1 s:Suite2:Bench3

...
```

[Configuration files](config.md) provide the setup for experiments by
defining benchmarks, benchmark suites, their parameters, and virtual machines
to execute them.

### Basic Execution: Run Experiments

ReBench takes a given configuration file, executes the experiments and stores
the measurement results into the configured data file. Assuming a basic
configuration as seen in the [README](index.md#install), the following command
line will execute all experiments and store the results in the `example.data`
file:

```bash
$ rebench example.conf
```

This basic execution can be customized in various ways as explained below.

### Partial Execution: Run Some of the Experiments

Instead of executing the configured experiments, we can ask ReBench to only
execute a subset of them, a specific experiment, only selected VMs, suites, and
benchmarks.

The [configuration file](config.md) allows us to select a
`default_experiment`. But we can override this setting with the `exp_name`
parameter. Thus, the following will execute only the `Example` experiment:

```bash
$ rebench example.conf Example
```

We can further restrict what is executed.
To only execute the `MyBin1` virtual machine, we use:

```bash
$ rebench example.conf Example vm:MyBin1
```

To further limit the execution, we can also select a specific benchmark from a
suite:

```bash
$ rebench example.conf Example vm:MyBin1 s:ExampleSuite:Bench1
```

The filters are applied on the set of *runs* identified by a configuration and
the chosen experiments. Thus, the above says to execute only `MyBin1`, and no
other virtual machine. For the resulting runs, we also want to execute only
`Bench1` in the `ExampleSuite`. If we list additional VMs, they are all
considered. Similarly, naming more benchmarks will include them all.

### Further Options

ReBench supports a range of other options to control execution.

#### Quick Runs, Iterations, Invocations

The [configuration](config.md#invocation) uses the notion of iteration
and invocation to define how often a VM is started (invocation) and how many
times a benchmark is executed in the same VM (iteration).

We can override this setting with the following parameters:

```text
-in INVOCATIONS, --invocations INVOCATIONS
                 The number of times a VM is started to execute a run.
-it ITERATIONS, --iterations ITERATIONS
                 The number of times a benchmark is to be executed
                 within a VM invocation.

-q, --quick      Execute quickly. Identical with --iterations=1 --invocations=1
```

#### Niceness

It is highly recommended to run benchmarks on an idle machine with all
unnecessary services disabled.
However, even if the machine is idle, it can happen that other processes
might desire processing time, which can lead to noise in the measurements.
To prevent such effects, it is recommended to run benchmarks with the highest
possible priority. On Linux systems, this is typically achieved with
the `nice` command and a niceness setting of `-20` (i.e., the process behaves
very not-nice).

Typically, this requires admin/root rights.
On Ubuntu, one can however allow a user to set negative niceness values
by adding the following line in `/etc/security/limits.conf`:

```text
user_executing_benchmarks    -       nice            -20
```

#### Discarding Data, Rerunning Experiments

ReBench's normal execution mode will assume that it should accumulate all data
until a complete data set is reached.
This means, we can interrupt execution at any point and continue later and
ReBench will continue where it left off.

Some times, we may want to update some experiments and discard old data:

```text
-c, --clean   Discard old data from the data file (configured in the run description).
-r, --rerun   Rerun selected experiments, and discard old data from data file.
```

#### Execution Order

We may care for a different order for the benchmark execution.
This could either be to get a quicker impression of the performance results.
But possibly also to account for the complexity of benchmarking and ensure
that the order does not influence results. 

For this purpose we use *schedulers* to determine the execution order.

```text
-s SCHEDULER, --scheduler=SCHEDULER
                        execution order of benchmarks: batch, round-robin,
                        random [default: batch]
```

#### Continuous Performance Tracking

ReBench supports [Codespeed][1] as platform for continuous performance
tracking. To report data to a Codespeed setup, the [configuration](config.md#codespeed)
needs to have the corresponding details.

And, Codespeed needs details on the concrete execution:

```text
--commit-id=COMMIT_ID     MANDATORY: when codespeed reporting is  used, the
                          commit-id has to be specified.

--environment=ENVIRONMENT MANDATORY: name the machine on which the results are
                          obtained.

--branch=BRANCH           The branch for which the results have to be recorded,
                          i.e., to which the commit belongs. Default: HEAD

--executable=EXECUTABLE   The executable name given to codespeed. Default: The
                          name used for the virtual machine.

--project=PROJECT         The project name given to codespeed. Default: Value
                          given in the config file.

-I, --disable-inc-report  Does a final report at the end instead of reporting
                          incrementally.

-S, --disable-codespeed   Override configuration and disable reporting to
                          codespeed.
